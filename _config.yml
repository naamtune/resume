  My name is Tune Katerungroch, an IT professional based in Southern California, USA. Having accumulated over 14 years of professional IT experience, I have fostered excellence in the following specialties: open-source intelligence gathering, network engineering, and systems administration. I am currently working for Consolidated Precision Products as a security analyst.

  My passion in technologies took root in a humble beginning of building home computer with my father on the floor of the living room when I was a toddler. As I grew older, I self-taught myself technical skills and concepts through hand-on experience and contents made available on the Internet. In later life, my career growth took a leap forward as I begun to professionally collaborate with peers in the industry. 

  I enjoy tackling the challenges of managing projects, hardware logistics, and technical issues that spring up, as if they are minigames and puzzles. Networking issues. Infrastructure planning, and figuring out resources are just some of the shapes and forms where challenges arise. The problem-solving skills and thought process is always a reflection of one’s neuroplasticity and the quality of the mental framework. 

  Much of my IT career have been spent supporting infrastructure within the logistics and manufacturing industry, thus I have deep understanding of the business operations and how these businesses utilize IT to grow and expand.

  Outside of my professional life, I can be found in the outdoor settings rappelling down waterfalls with my teams, and scaling steep rocky desert mountains with my friends. If I’m not outside on weekend adventures as weekend warrior, I can also be found volunteering my time to community services offering my time to non-profit organizations, serving the communities in search and rescue missions, wandering the metro cities doing urban photography, and spending quality time at home with my family.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>network security</mark>, <mark>network switching</mark>, <mark>open-source intelligence gathering</mark>, <mark>Windows Server administration</mark>, and <mark>project management</mark>.
